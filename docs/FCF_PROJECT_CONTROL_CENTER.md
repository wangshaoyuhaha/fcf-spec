# 0.1 FCF SUPREME PRINCIPLES


## Human Sovereignty Principle


FCF is designed as:

A self-evolving digital asset cognition operating system.


FCF uses:

- Code for deterministic calculation
- AI for reasoning and explanation
- Governance for risk control


Final decision authority and real capital execution authority belong only to human operators.


FCF can:

- analyze
- explain
- simulate
- review
- archive


FCF cannot:

- automatically decide
- automatically execute
- automatically manage capital
- replace human responsibility


---

# Math by Code, Reasoning by LLM


Deterministic calculations must be completed by code.


Python owns:

- probability calculation
- scoring calculation
- risk calculation
- ranking calculation
- backtest statistics
- data quality calculation


AI owns:

- explanation
- summarization
- logical reasoning
- scenario discussion


AI cannot:

- invent numbers
- modify calculated results
- create unsupported data


---

# Data Quality Gate Principle


Bad data must not enter intelligence processing.

Human Review


Invalid data must be:

- blocked
- quarantined
- reviewed


AI must never generate confident explanations from invalid data.

# 1. PROJECT IDENTITY


FCF is:

A multi-asset financial market paper-only research and cognition framework.


Supported assets:

- Stocks
- BTC
- Futures
- Other financial assets


FCF is NOT:

- trading bot
- execution system
- broker system
- exchange system
- automatic investment system

# 3. CORE FREEZE CONSTITUTION


P1-P47 Core is frozen.


Forbidden:

- P48 expansion
- core mutation
- score mutation
- reason code mutation
- risk flag deletion
- risk flag downgrade
- source overwrite


Future expansion must happen through Sidecar only.# 4. SIDE-CAR ARCHITECTURE REGISTRY


## Sidecar Expansion Rule


After P1-P47 Core Freeze:

All future capability expansion must use Sidecar architecture.


Sidecar can:

- read approved artifacts
- analyze
- explain
- review
- archive


Sidecar cannot:

- modify core
- replace core
- bypass governance
- create execution path

Historical Record



Reason:

Archive must remain immutable.



---

# 8. READ / WRITE CONTRACT


Universal rule:


Each Sidecar:


READ:

Only approved input artifacts.


WRITE:

Only own generated artifacts.


Forbidden:

Writing into another component output.



---

# 9. AUTHORITY MODEL


Python:

Owns deterministic calculation.


AI:

Owns explanation and reasoning.


Human Operator:

Owns final decision authority.



FCF never owns:

- real trading authority
- execution authority
- capital management authority



---

# 10. OPERATOR REVIEW STATES


Allowed:


REVIEW_REQUIRED

REVIEW_RECORDED

REJECTED

ARCHIVED


Avoid:


APPROVED


Reason:

Approval language may imply execution authorization.# 11. GAP REGISTER


Purpose:

Track known architecture gaps.

Gap does not mean failure.

Gap means:

Known area requiring future review or design.
